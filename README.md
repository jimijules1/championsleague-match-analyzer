#### Run Program
To run the program, execute main.py after completing the prerequisites.
The program first performs data exploration. It checks the performance of home and away teams and their combined winning streak.
Then, it checks home and away goals.
To continue, I want to find out which team performed significantly better with spectators than without spectators (during covid years) to understand the fan base of the individual teams.
